This means that a compiler turns the code we write into executable code before running it. So whats actually happening when we use <code>go run</code> is that is that the code is compiled into a temporary file then executed, which makes this command useful for quick testing or debugging errors. However, when we use <code>go build</code> we are creating the actual executable file that can be run without a Go environment. This is similar to the <code>gcc</code> command that is used in the C programming language which creates a executable file that you can later run. This method is useful for when you have a completed product that you are ready to distribute or deploy.</p> <p>Congratulations, now you have created your first program in Go! Good luck on your programming journey!</p>"}]}
